# Design Guide GlPortal
## Functionality over Realism
Look at the most advanced and realistic AAA game engine you can find. 
Is it still looking like a bunch of textured polygons? 

I thought so.

Our aim with the GlPortal engine is to produce an enjoyable game and not to go on a wild goose chase after photorealistic 
graphics that will be outdated the second they are released. 

## Functionality over Polishing
Don't try to polish the visuals of a feature to perfection before adding it. Most functions will still be fun even if you 
use simple placeholder models. The look will be improved upon in iterations.
