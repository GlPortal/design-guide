# Story Design
## Simplicity instead of Detailing
When for any character a voiceover is enough then go with it. There are plenty of explainations why only the voice of somebody will be heard.

## Limit exposure
Try to convey as much as possible through visuals and gameplay. Don't have characters explain things that should be obvious to people inhabiting the game world. Make dialogues about things that matter to the world and how the characters relate to it.
